# Agoric Dapp

**This `README-agoric-dapp.md` file is a generic guide to [Agoric](https://agoric.com) Dapp projects**

This directory is the an Agoric Dapp project.  A Dapp is a *distributed application* which typically has a browser-based user interface, a public API server, and a contract running on the Agoric blockchain.

## Using this Dapp

First, see the online documentation at https://agoric.com/documentation/getting-started/

If you have installed the [Agoric CLI](https://agoric.com/documentation/getting-started#prerequisites) and you just want to try running this Dapp locally (on a simulated Agoric VM, not an actual public chain), you can:

```sh
# Install the project dependencies
agoric install
# Start the Agoric VM
agoric start --reset
```

Leave this command running (it is your simulated environment).  Then, in a separate terminal:

```sh
# Start the user interface
cd ui && yarn start
```

Then in a third terminal, deploy the contract and API to the VM.

```sh
# Deploy a new instance of the contract to the VM
agoric deploy contract/deploy.js
# Reset the VM's API server
agoric deploy api/deploy.js
```

You can then navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view your Dapp.

## Modifying this Dapp

In the Agoric system, components are written in Javascript.

## Components

The following are the important directories in an Agoric Dapp project:

- [`contract`](#contract) define and deploy the on-chain contract
- [`api`](#api) define and deploy the chain-connected server's `/api` HTTP endpoint
- [`ui`](#ui) the browser user interface that connects between the user's personal wallet and the API server

Other files and directories in this toplevel folder should not typically be modified.

### Contract directory

In the `contract` directory, you can find the following files to edit:

- `init` contract initialization modules, starting with `init/custom-deploy.js`
- `src` contract source code, starting with `src/contract.js`

Other files and folders that you don't typically need to edit:

- `deploy.js` generic Agoric contract deployment script
- `lib` library modules provided by Agoric and used by the contract

### API

In the `api` directory, you can find the following files to edit:

- `src` /api endpoint handler, starting with `src/handler.js`

Other files and folders that you don't typicaly need to edit:

- `deploy.js` generic Agoric API handler deployment script

### UI

The `ui` directory is almost completely under your control.  The only files and folders that you don't typically need to edit:

- `public/lib` Agoric UI library
- `public/conf` configuration files that are generated by the `contract/deploy.js` script
